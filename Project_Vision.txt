#Main Idea
- Our Vision Project for our game that mimicks "Touhou Fuujinroku ~ Mountain Of Faith" developed by Mediascape, is a guinea pig trying to escape
the clutches of a chef. 

#Player
- [Health : 6] [Lives: 3]
- Player is awarded lives at point milestones
- taking damage loses point, dealing damage increases points
- Controls
	* Arrow Keys to move around
	* Shift slows movement
	* esc pauses the game
- Hitbox smaller than sprite 5 x 5 pixels, holding shift will show colored white dot of hitbox
- bullets come out of self untill you get orbs

MOST ENEMIES WHEN SHOOTING DIRECTED BULLETS SHOOT FAST BUT THEN IMMEDIATELY SLOW DOWN TO STAY ON SCREEN LONGER
#Enemies
- The four enemies that will be in the game will be,
	* first grunt enemy will be a bird with egg projecticles, [Health : 1.25]
              - these one kind of float around at the top and just do whatever ill give pathing a go later.
              BirdTriangle: (small bullet) directed shots at player with 1, then 2, then 3 in very close intervals but not the same time. the bullets seperate (Just a change in angle when spawned)  from the center if odd number the center bullet does not.  
	* the second grunt enemy will be a cat with hairball projectiles, [Health : 0.65]
             - Some spawn in towards you, some shoot their projectile, some spawn in on a path, some spawn in a row at the top, some spawn in and then drift down the screen just to annoy you
             CatCircle: (small bullet) cirlce shot of 15 bullets 
             CatBIGBULLET: (Big bullet) directed shot of a big bullet
	* the mid boss will be an evil guinea pig working with the chef with hamster ball projectiles, [Health : 2.5]
		phase 1:
              - (Big Bullet) 3 burst 6 seperated bullets shots of big bullets spreading out (Just a change in angle when spawned) 
              - (small bullet) 2 burst cirlce shots of 27 bullets
		phase2:
              - (medium bullet) directed single shot with one bullet going straight then 4 times there are going to be 2 more bullets at opposite angles but each itteration of the 2 bullets has a greater angle almost 
                              making a triangle.
	* and the final boss will be the chef throwing coal or another projecticle. [Health : 32] 
              First Phase:
                  - (small bullet) 2 circle shots of 17 circling the boss bullets they all push out of boss then come back in a little towards the direction of their spawn point and then push out at a slower speed 
                  - have 2 bullets spawners symetric from each other and some distance away from the enemy push them outward from enemy while going in a cirlce and spawn targeted bullets at the player for how long who know maybe 3 seconds but make it spawn them fast and a good amount of them XD
              Second Phase:
                  - (small bullet) 2 circle shots of 17 bullets they all push out of boss then come back in a little towards the direction of their spawn point and then push out at a slower speed 
                  - have 1 bullet spawner that starts from the center of boss then goes outward from enemy in a circle spawning 3 direction bullets in small intervals the first direction will be targeted at the player the other two directions are opposite of the targeted player but one at an angle of 45 degrees right and one at 45 degrees to the left.
