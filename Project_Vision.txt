_____Project Vision_____

----- Main Idea -----
    Our Project will mimick many patterns of stage 1 and the UI of the game "Touhou Fuujinroku ~ Mountain Of Faith" (By Mediascape), 
however the theme of our game will be different. The theme will be a guinea pig trying to escape the clutches of a chef
trying to capture and prepare the guinea pig for a meal.
